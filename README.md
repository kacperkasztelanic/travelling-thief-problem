# Travelling Thief Problem Solutions
Solutions of the Travelling Thief Problem (TTP) as described in: https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~zbyszek/Papers/TTP.pdf

The implemented solutions makes use of the following metaheuristics: 
- genetic algorithm
- tabu search
- simulated annealing 

There is also a hybrid solutions consisting of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing as improvement strategy.

The results are presented both on graphs and as text-based statistics.
